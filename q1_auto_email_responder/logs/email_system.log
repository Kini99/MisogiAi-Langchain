Databases can sound intimidating. But they’re the #1 most important building block for you to get stuff done—from task trackers and product roadmaps to storing all your docs.

Now your databases just got the biggest refresh in Notion history: a clean new design, easier to use, and more capable than ever.

Try a database → ( https://notion.so/build-database?utm_campaign=What%27s+New+2.52+-+Databases+-+Personal&utm_campaignid=759&utm_campaigntype=seg_attr&utm_content=Email+1+-+Personal&utm_medium=email_action&utm_source=customer.io )

“Try a database” works when opened on desktop.

************************
Databases got a makeover
************************

From clearer names and cleaner tables to simpler settings, gentler visuals, and fewer distractions, databases just got much simpler! The new “+ property” makes naming and picking a property much smoother. You can now group, insert, or rename properties right from the property menu. Web, desktop, mobile— all refreshed! See the full list of updates ( https://x.com/NotionHQ/status/1935380233265496134?utm_campaign=What%27s+New+2.52+-+Databases+-+Personal&utm_campaignid=759&utm_campaigntype=seg_attr&utm_content=Email+1+-+Personal&utm_medium=email_action&utm_source=customer.io )

New <code>Feed</code> view to review content ( https://www.notion.so/?utm_campaign=What%27s+New+2.52+-+Databases+-+Personal&utm_campaignid=759&utm_campaigntype=seg_attr&utm_content=Email+1+-+Personal&utm_medium=email_action&utm_source=customer.io )

*******************************
New Feed view to review content
*******************************

Like turning your database into a blog feed! Use it to scroll through tasks, updates, research, class notes and more. Just add a new view to your database and select Feed.

New Feed view to review content ( https://www.notion.so/?utm_campaign=What%27s+New+2.52+-+Databases+-+Personal&utm_campaignid=759&utm_campaigntype=seg_attr&utm_content=Email+1+-+Personal&utm_medium=email_action&utm_source=customer.io )

****************************************
Chat with your database in research mode
****************************************

Now Notion AI can answer extra-complex questions about your databases, drawing info across properties and any notes inside your database pages.

Try it by going to Home, selecting the Research tab, and @-mention a database in your
question.

Chat with your database in research mode ( https://www.notion.so/?utm_campaign=What%27s+New+2.52+-+Databases+-+Personal&utm_campaignid=759&utm_campaigntype=seg_attr&utm_content=Email+1+-+Personal&utm_medium=email_action&utm_source=customer.io )

**************************************
Database row permissions (coming soon)
**************************************

Notion’s #2 most requested feature is nearly here! (#1 is offline mode, also coming very soon! ( https://x.com/ivanhzhao/status/1917945420975841318?utm_campaign=What%27s+New+2.52+-+Databases+-+Personal&utm_campaignid=759&utm_campaigntype=seg_attr&utm_content=Email+1+-+Personal&utm_medium=email_action&utm_source=customer.io )) You’ll be able to grant permissions by database row. The person assigned to those database pages won’t be able to see the rest of the database 😅. Stay tuned.

***********************************
Search Gmail with Enterprise Search
***********************************

Have 17,362 messages in your Gmail inbox? Notion AI can help. Search through older archives and new emails to get the latest updates on a project or summarize a long thread. We maintain strict privacy controls, so each user can only see their own inbox. Available on Business and Enterprise plans.

…and search your Gmail inbox ( https://www.notion.so/?utm_campaign=What%27s+New+2.52+-+Databases+-+Personal&utm_campaignid=759&utm_campaigntype=seg_attr&utm_content=Email+1+-+Personal&utm_medium=email_action&utm_source=customer.io )

*************************************
Importing CSVs just got a lot cleaner
*************************************

Now you can select which Notion Property Type you want to use for each CSV column, making imports so much tidier! Simply upload and create a new database or merge your CSV with an existing database.

Importing CSVs just got a lot cleaner ( https://www.notion.so/?utm_campaign=What%27s+New+2.52+-+Databases+-+Personal&utm_campaignid=759&utm_campaigntype=seg_attr&utm_content=Email+1+-+Personal&utm_medium=email_action&utm_source=customer.io )

*************************************
Build with Replit, manage with Notion
*************************************

Vibe coding continues to amaze us. Now you can connect your apps and websites to a Notion database to manage all the content: visual assets, posts, and tasks. Check out this Replit demo ( https://x.com/mattppal/status/1927364391281799504?utm_campaign=What%27s+New+2.52+-+Databases+-+Personal&utm_campaignid=759&utm_campaigntype=seg_attr&utm_content=Email+1+-+Personal&utm_medium=email_action&utm_source=customer.io ).

Improvements
************

* Databases are way easier to use on mobile ( https://x.com/NotionHQ/status/1935737823707165156?utm_campaign=What%27s+New+2.52+-+Databases+-+Personal&utm_campaignid=759&utm_campaigntype=seg_attr&utm_content=Email+1+-+Personal&utm_medium=email_action&utm_source=customer.io ). Tap, view, edit, or create filters with a couple flicks of your thumb.
* Manage any Notion database in Notion Calendar if it includes dates. Just click into the view and select Open in Calendar. Great for tracking deadlines.
* Search your PDFs in Notion, Google Drive, SharePoint and OneDrive with Enterprise Search!
* Google Drive AI Connector can now search across more file types: .docx, pptx, xlsx, csv, and PDFs.

“Try a database” works when opened on desktop.

We hope this makes databases, the beating heart of your Notion workspace, a little easier! We promise to keep finding more ways to improve this tool for you.

[AWS Health may periodically trigger reminder notifications about this communication if resources remain unresolved.]

Starting September 15, 2025, AWS Amplify Console will end support for Node.js 14, Node.js 16 and Node.js 18. After this date, you will not be able to deploy updates to your application until you upgrade your Node version. Please update all applications that use Node.js 14, Node.js 16 and Node.js 18 to Node.js 20+ before September 15, 2025.

Please note that, already deployed applications with Node.js 14, Node.js 16 and Node.js 18 will continue to run, and will not be impacted unless you need to deploy updates. 

We recommend testing your application on a new branch before upgrading to ensure all app functionality works. For migration guidelines, visit the "I need to update my application's Node.js version" section on page [1].

A list of affected resources can be found in the "Affected resources" tab of the AWS Health Dashboard. 

If you have any questions or concerns, please reach out to AWS Support [2].

 <https://www.mongodb.com/>

Create an efficient data model in MongoDB





When building modern applications, your data model needs to evolve as quickly 
as your features do — without downtime, expensive refactoring, or performance 
bottlenecks.



Leveraging the document model makes it easier to design schemas that keep up 
with today's ever-changing applications.



To begin building your data model, try our Schema Builder 
<https://chatgpt.com/g/g-J3KcWl0wj-mdb-schema-builder>, a custom GPT tool 
designed to guide you in making schema decisions as you start or expand on your 
data modeling journey.

 <https://chatgpt.com/g/g-J3KcWl0wj-mdb-schema-builder>

To see the Schema Builder in action, watch our live coding session, Coding 
with AI Coders and MongoDB ChatGPT Schema Builder 
<https://www.youtube.com/live/4dknA21jsII?feature=shared>. We build a fully 
deployed music streaming application while demonstrating how Schema Builder’s 
methodology and AI-powered context simplify data modeling on MongoDB.

Create an effective data model in MongoDB


In MongoDB, storing related data that’s frequently accessed together isn’t 
just recommended, it’s critical for query performance. MongoDB’s document model 
encourages embedding to deliver simpler, faster queries and low-latency 
performance at scale, making it easier to represent your query access patterns 
intuitively and similar to how you do in code, as intuitive objects.



Plus, you still get the structure and data integrity 
<https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/data-modeling/data-consistency/> you 
expect thanks to schema validation, multi-document ACID transactions, and more.



Want to build confidence with MongoDB’s approach to data modeling? MongoDB 
Skill Badges are free credentials designed to help you quickly learn and 
validate your MongoDB skills in just 60–90 minutes.

 Hey Folks, 
What’s changing? 
Our current forum on Discourse will be closing soon. We’re moving the whole community to a new Discord server so everyone can connect faster and chat in real time. 
Key dates to remember 

Monday, 30 June 2025 – Discord launches inside your LMS.
After that, we’ll start winding down the Discourse site and shut it off completely post discord rollout.

What you need to do 

On 30 June, look for the Discord invite link in your LMS dashboard.
Click the link, join the new server, and explore the channels.
Say hello so your friends know you made it!

Why Discord? 

Instant discussions.
Easy voice, video, and screen-sharing.
Lot of Fun events and activities already in the works.

We’re excited about this next step and can’t wait to see you on Discord. Lots of fresh ideas and activities are coming your way—stay tuned! 
See you there!

Hi Kinjal,

As you get up and running, we have a few tips to help make the most of Notion. Notion AI is here to help you spark creativity, unlock productivity and live smarter:

Brainstorm and get inspired

No more dreading a blank page. Ask AI to write up some ideas to get you started! Let it know some background and your goals to see how it would tackle a task or project.

Campaign brainstorm ( https://www.notion.so/gallery/categories/ai?utm_campaign=%5BUpdated%5D+Creator+Onboarding+2025&utm_campaignid=652&utm_campaigntype=transactional&utm_content=Email+2+-+AI+-+Rebranded&utm_medium=email_action&utm_source=customer.io )

Summarize and get next steps

Free up time to think about what comes next instead of what happened. AI can create a summary of a page or project and outline next steps, instantly.

Summarize ( https://www.notion.so/gallery/categories/ai?utm_campaign=%5BUpdated%5D+Creator+Onboarding+2025&utm_campaignid=652&utm_campaigntype=transactional&utm_content=Email+2+-+AI+-+Rebranded&utm_medium=email_action&utm_source=customer.io )

Check grammar and edit tone

Instead of pulling up an AI chatbot or browser extension, you can write and edit where you’re working. Make your tone more confident or easily check text to ensure perfect spelling and grammar. Just highlight a selection and click “Ask AI”.

Change tone ( https://www.notion.so/gallery/categories/ai?utm_campaign=%5BUpdated%5D+Creator+Onboarding+2025&utm_campaignid=652&utm_campaigntype=transactional&utm_content=Email+2+-+AI+-+Rebranded&utm_medium=email_action&utm_source=customer.io )

Try it out ( https://www.notion.so/gallery/categories/ai?utm_campaign=%5BUpdated%5D+Creator+Onboarding+2025&utm_campaignid=652&utm_campaigntype=transactional&utm_content=Email+2+-+AI+-+Rebranded&utm_medium=email_action&utm_source=customer.io )

Hi Kinjal,

Now that you’re up and running, we wanted to tell you about three features that will power your Notion workflows:

1) Slash commands

Type / to pull up a menu that lets you add countless content types — from text and images to powerful databases.

Task list ( http://www.notion.so/f4cc8b01760d4930b9bfde36a7295f6d?duplicate=true&from=notion_template_gallery&workspaceId=7c4e6d53-bf01-8168-8f5a-000379677db1&utm_campaign=%5BUpdated%5D+Creator+Onboarding+2025&utm_campaignid=652&utm_campaigntype=transactional&utm_content=Email+1B+-+Subpage+Bonus+-+Rebranded&utm_medium=email_action&utm_source=customer.io )

2) Subpages

There are no folders in Notion. Instead, you can organize pages inside pages (inside pages). Here’s how to create subpages.

Subpages ( http://www.notion.so/f4cc8b01760d4930b9bfde36a7295f6d?duplicate=true&from=notion_template_gallery&workspaceId=7c4e6d53-bf01-8168-8f5a-000379677db1&utm_campaign=%5BUpdated%5D+Creator+Onboarding+2025&utm_campaignid=652&utm_campaigntype=transactional&utm_content=Email+1B+-+Subpage+Bonus+-+Rebranded&utm_medium=email_action&utm_source=customer.io )

3) Sidebar

The left sidebar is where you’ll organize your content. You can create and arrange pages, import content from other tools, and use templates.

Sidebar ( http://www.notion.so/f4cc8b01760d4930b9bfde36a7295f6d?duplicate=true&from=notion_template_gallery&workspaceId=7c4e6d53-bf01-8168-8f5a-000379677db1&utm_campaign=%5BUpdated%5D+Creator+Onboarding+2025&utm_campaignid=652&utm_campaigntype=transactional&utm_content=Email+1B+-+Subpage+Bonus+-+Rebranded&utm_medium=email_action&utm_source=customer.io )

Why Atlas Search?

 * A unified platform: Seamless integration with your existing MongoDB 
database means you don't have to stand up and manage a separate sync mechanism
 * Dedicated hardware: Separate your search workload from your database 
workloads for high availability.Learn more
